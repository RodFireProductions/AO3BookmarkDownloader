# AO3 Bookmark Downloader

**This branch is in development.**

A desktop app for bulk downloading all of your bookmarks from AO3.

If you're like me and have hundreds of bookmarks, the idea of downloading each
individually is probably daunting.

## To Do:
- Finish database integration
- Redo download functions

## Development
Coded with Python 3.13

1. Install requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    py main.py
    ```

### GUI
The `gui.ui` file was made using [QtDesigner](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html),
so if you choose to make edits, I suggest you do so via that.


## Having Issues?
